Drive pulleys should have grooves in the rubber lagging to prevent hydroplaning similar to the grooves in a car tire. Typical grooves are in a herringbone or diamond pattern. Rubber lagging with ceramic tiles embedded can be used in applications with excessive moisture or ice where belt slippage at the drive pulley is a problem.<\/p>","video":"\/videos\/1_Product_1_Profiled End Disc Drum_Drive Pulley_Trimmed.mp4","bg":"\/images\/drive-pulley1.jpg"},{"title":"Profiled End Disc Pulley ","id":"drum2","content":"<p><strong>Martin Profiled End Disc Pulleys are engineered to offer an efficient and improved alternative to Standard & Mine Duty Drum Pulleys.<\/strong> Profiled End Disc Pulleys simplify the selection as they can be used in a wide range of applications thus reducing replacement inventory.

Due to the proximity of a snub pulley to the drive pulley, it is recommended that this be a flat face pulley instead of crowned.<\/p>","video":"\/videos\/6_Product 6_Profiled End Disc_Trimmed.mp4","bg":"\/images\/drive-pulley2.jpg"}]},"cleanflight":[],"wingpulley":[],"carryiders":[],"returnidlers":[],"drives":[],"impactbed":[],"coupling":[]}';
